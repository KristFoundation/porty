Any and I mean ANY! bad distrobution of Porty not modified, not approved, not licensed under MIT License or claimed to be yours will be reported

This is a *distribution* by Lemmmy of a distributio by Yevano a distribution by sci4me of a *distribution* by Inklit of a distribution by BTCTaras of a distribution (not distrobution) of porty by apemanzilla, so it doesn't break the rules.

What the hell is this repo anyway
